# find_missing_xor

You are given an array A of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.


One could imagine applications where the elements are not integers from 1 to n:

The set of potential elements are Person objects and we ought to find the Person missing from a list of values
The set of potential elements are all nodes in a graph and we are looking for a missing node
The set of potential elements are integers in general (not necessarily from 1 to n) and we want to find a missing integer
